# Portfolio: Covid-19 React Project

This project is created by Robin HJ Kwon for portfolio purpose.

This react web application is to track current status of Covid-19 using API.

API: https://covid19api.com

â€» Somehow, the current data is not accurate. The current recovered data is set to 0, so it causes incorrect active cases.
